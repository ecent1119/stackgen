## stackgen — Local Dev Stack Generator (CLI/TUI)

---

### Short Description (under 280 chars)

Generate local dev Docker Compose stacks in minutes. Select databases, caches, and runtimes — get docker-compose.yml, Dockerfiles, .env wiring, and test containers. One-time purchase. No SaaS.

---

### Full Description

**stackgen** is a standalone CLI/TUI tool for generating **local development and test Docker Compose environments** using **production-aligned reference configurations**.

It helps developers spin up realistic multi-service stacks quickly, without hand-writing compose files, Dockerfiles, or environment wiring.

This is a **one-time purchase** digital product.
No SaaS. No accounts. No background services.

---

#### What stackgen does

stackgen interactively generates a ready-to-use local dev stack by:

* Selecting services (databases, caches, runtimes)
* Generating Docker Compose files
* Creating language-specific build/runtime containers
* Wiring services together via a generated `.env`
* Targeting an existing project folder or creating a new one
* Generating test containers and test function scaffolding

The result is a **deterministic, editable baseline** you fully control.

---

#### Supported services (optional, selectable)

**Datastores**

* Neo4j (Community Edition)
* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* Microsoft SQL Server (Developer Edition)
* Redis
* Redis Stack (Community)

**Application runtimes**

* Go (build + server containers)
* Go test container
* Node.js (framework presets)
* Java
* Rust
* C#
* Python

All services use **official or widely adopted base images**, with clear version pinning and readable defaults.

---

#### Generated output

stackgen generates:

* `docker-compose.yml`
* Optional service-specific Dockerfiles
* `.env` and `.env.example`
* Named networks and volumes
* Predictable service naming
* Sensible local defaults
* Test containers and scaffolding

Everything is **plain text and editable**.
Nothing is hidden or locked in.

---

#### Designed for

* Local development
* Integration testing
* Prototyping
* Reference architectures
* Onboarding new projects
* Standardizing dev environments

---

#### Explicit scope

stackgen is intentionally scoped for **local development and testing**.

It provides **production-aligned reference configurations**, but it is **not** a production deployment tool.

Generated configurations **must be reviewed, adapted, and secured** before any production use.

---

#### What this is not

* Not a hosting platform
* Not a deployment service
* Not a compliance or security guarantee
* Not a managed environment

You own and control all generated output.

---

#### Why stackgen exists

Writing and maintaining compose files, env wiring, and build containers is repetitive, error-prone, and time-consuming.

stackgen compresses that work into minutes while keeping everything transparent and customizable.

You save time.
You keep control.
